This is an example home page for a company who makes and sells stained glass windows. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers and a contact form.

This page is an example home for a drive-in movie theater, based on a local drive-in theater. It was styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components, including a navbar, jumbotron, form and cards.
