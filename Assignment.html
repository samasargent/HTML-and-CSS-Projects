		<h1>All About Cats</h1>
		<h3>Breeds</h3>
			<p>There are many different breeds of cat. At the time of this writing, there are at least 42 different breeds that are recognized.</p>
		<p>Here is a quote from Hill's Pet Nutrition:</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.hillspet.com/cat-care/new-pet-parent/how-many-cat-breeds-are-there"><i>
			Finding out how many cat breeds exist in the world depends on where you look for your information. International cat registries and other organizations all list different qualifications for the breeds they accept, and the total number varies among themâ€”though there are far fewer recognized cat breeds than there are dog breeds. While Encyclopedia Britannica only lists fifteen cat breeds, The International Cat Association, the world's largest genetic registry of pedigreed cats, recognizes seventy-three different kinds. Many other well-recognized registries and associations tend to fall between those two numbers.
