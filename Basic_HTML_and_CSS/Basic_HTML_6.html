		<h3>Fire and Ice</h3>
		<p>Some say the world will end in <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">fire</span>,<br>
			Some say in <span style="color:lightskyblue;font-weight:bold">ice</span>.<br>
			From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire<br>
			I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
			But if it had to perish twice,<br>
			I think I know enough of hate<br>
			To say that for destruction ice<br>
			Is also great<br>
			And would suffice.<br>

		<h3>AM/PM</h3>
		<p>my favorite time of the day is 4&nbsp;am,<br>
			or maybe it's my favorite time of the night.<br>
		<br>
			whether I'm just waking up,<br>
			or just going to sleep,<br>
		<br>
			the calm darkness and quiet reminds me<br>
			that right now it's only me and the moon.<br>
		<br>
			I like to think that she listens.<br>
			I talk to her like company.<br>
		<br>
			this is the most cozy time of night,<br>
			or maybe the easiest part of the day.<br>
		<br>
			she is the only thing<br>
			that always comes back to me.<br>
			-Hannah
